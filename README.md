# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains the project work for the "Applied Data Science Capstone" course, the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. The capstone project provides a comprehensive summary of all the materials and topics covered throughout the entire specialization, presented in the form of an in-depth data analysis project.

## Project Background

**SpaceX** is leading the charge in the commercial space age, making space travel more accessible and affordable than ever before. On their website, SpaceX advertises the Falcon 9 rocket launches with a starting price of 62 million dollars. In contrast, other providers typically charge upwards of 165 million dollars. A significant portion of SpaceX's savings comes from its innovative approach to reusing the first stage of the rockets. Predicting whether SpaceX will be able to reuse the first stage of a rocket launch can provide insights into the potential costs associated with that launch.

### Key Questions
- How do factors like payload mass, launch site, flight frequency, and orbits influence the success rate of the first stage landing?
- Has the success rate of first stage landings been improving over time?
- Which machine learning algorithm is most suited for binary classification in this scenario?

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**
    - Employed web scraping techniques to extract relevant data from Wikipedia.

2. **Data Wrangling**
    - Filtered the raw data to obtain relevant records.
    - Handled missing values to maintain data integrity.
    - Applied One Hot Encoding to transform categorical variables, making the data ready for binary classification.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset using both visualizations and SQL.

4. **Interactive Visual Analytics**
    - Utilized tools like Folium for geospatial visualization.
    - Employed Plotly Dash for creating interactive visual analytics dashboards.

5. **Predictive Analysis**
    - Built, tuned, and evaluated various classification models to determine the best predictor for whether the first stage of a rocket would be reused.
